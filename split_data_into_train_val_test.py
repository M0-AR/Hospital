"""
To split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets and organize images and labels into corresponding folders, you may follow the below steps:

Use os and shutil to create directories and move files.
Use glob to retrieve all image and label files.
Use random to shuffle and split the data into train, validation, and test sets.

Notes:

os.makedirs: ensures the directories are created.
The script assumes you have .png image files and corresponding .txt label files.
random.shuffle: randomizes the order of the files before splitting them.
The script moves the files into a structure suitable for machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Splitting ratios (70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing) are quite common, but you might adjust them according to your use case.
Make sure that each image file has a corresponding label file with the exact same name before running the script.
Always double-check manually if some of the files are moved correctly and datasets are split as expected. This will ensure that you donâ€™t train/test your model on incorrect data.
Be careful with file moving and deleting operations, make sure to have a backup of your data.
